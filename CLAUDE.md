## Browser-drive verification (Playwright MCP + Claude Chrome)

Agents verify UI work by driving a real browser BEFORE asking a human to walk the surface. Two tiers:

- **Codified (default): Playwright MCP** — navigate/click/type, accessibility-tree snapshots, DOM assertions; headless-capable, runs unwatched. Wire it per repo at **project scope** (config lands in the committed `.mcp.json`):

  ```bash
  claude mcp add -s project playwright -- npx @playwright/mcp@latest
  ```

- **Interactive: `claude --chrome`** (or `/chrome` → enable by default) — Claude drives the operator's real Chrome while they watch; screenshots/GIFs + console and network logs.

Rules that make it safe and cheap:

1. Newly added MCP servers load in the **next** session, not the current one (same rule as skills symlinks).
2. Prefer **accessibility snapshots over screenshots** — raster is token-expensive; use it only for visual questions (layout, theme).
3. Browser-driven **reads are unrestricted; writes only against the repo's designated safe target** — never mint test entities in shared/canonical data.
4. The drive's click-path is **named in the phase plan before implementation**; a drive that lives only in a session transcript is not codified.
5. A browser drive proves the buttons **work**; the human walk-through still judges whether the surface is **usable**. It augments the human rung, never replaces it.

Full pattern: `context-v/blueprints/Browser-Drive-Verification-For-Agent-Sessions.md` at the anchor monorepo root (kit rollout draft: `ai-labs/context-vigilance-kit/context-v/blueprints/`). Loop integration proven in `ai-labs/augment-it/context-v/loops/`.
